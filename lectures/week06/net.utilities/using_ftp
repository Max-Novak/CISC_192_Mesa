using_ftp:
TRANSFERRING FILES TO AND FROM A SERVER USING FTP, (PSFTP.EXE)
PSCP.EXE OR SCP (scp).

You will use one or another FTP (file transfer protocol)
program intensively your whole working life.

If you are using a Windows PC:
When you are ready to upload the program file to the Mesa
system, you can use the "psftp.exe" program on the class
web page to get files from the local system to Mesa:

Be sure you've put the USB drive in the USB port,

From Firefox, navigate to the class
web page at http://209.129.16.61/~hhaller/data/cisc192

double-click psftp.exe

a command-window will pop up, type:

	open 209.129.16.61 

when prompted "login:" enter your assigned login name, when prompted
"passwd:" enter your password

YOUR PASSWORD WILL NOT ECHO TO THE SCREEN FOR REASONS WHICH SHOULD
BE OBVIOUS.

if you're uploading assignment 0, you would change directory (cd) to
the asst1 subdir so:

	cd asst0

then, type 

	put e:\yourfilename.cpp

(e: may be wrong, you must know which disk letter your thumbdrive or
floppy is, what subdirectory holds your file, and use that.)

wait until the transfer is complete, then type: quit

(To reverse the process and copy the file to your computer, after you
create an ftp connection as described above, type

	lcd e:\    

(that's Local Change Directory)

	get yourfilename.cpp

and your file will be downloaded from the mainframe and
saved on your A: drive.

If you're on a system with a Unix command line, you may
copy files to or from your directory on the distance system:

scp myacct@distant.com:filewanted .
or:
scp ./filetosend myacct@distant.com:
