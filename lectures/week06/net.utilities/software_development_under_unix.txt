END SUMMARY

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ON UNIX MAINFRAMES (1)

We use the Linux system differently than Windows, we use the CLI
("Command Line Interface") which is driven by you, the user, typing in
commands and pressing ENTER to execute them.  It is very fast,
powerful, and efficient, like a jet fighter, but like an airplane, it
requires practice to use well.

The password for online students (oryxNN), (until you change it, which
you should do NOW with the "passwd" commmand) is at the head of the file
containing student login names, "maxnames", "oryxnames", depending on
which class section you are in.

Here's a quick explanation of how to use passwd, you can
(once you log in) read the Linux Manual with the "man"
command:

$ man passwd

will explain everything about passwd to you, pressing space
displays the next screen, and pressing q when you're done
will terminate the manual page.

To get an intro to Linux, try:

$ man intro

A "good" password is a word that no dictionary holds.
Make it hard to shoulder-surf.

====================================================

To create (edit) a file first.cpp, you would type:

jpico first.cpp

at the command prompt ($) and press RETURN

Once you've saved the result, you'll compile it with:

g++ first.cpp 

We often make errors in programs.

If you made programming mistakes, the compiler will list errors to the
screen to guide you in repairing your Source Code.

Read the first error closely, then go back into the editor, move to
the line on which the error occurred, and fix the error.  Then save
the file, and attempt to re-compile. 

Executing the program:

Once your program compiles without syntax errors, there
will be a new file "a.out", which the compiler creates
from your Source Code.  This is the executable module
which was built from your pgoram.  To run it, simply type
its name at the command prompt:

	a.out

Just because you fixed all the syntax errors, that doesn't mean
your program is correct logically.  Now you must run and test
your program against a variety of correct and incorrect input.

UNIX PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT TOOLS:

Editor:
	$ jpico yourprogramname.cpp (or)
	$ pico yourprogramname.cpp (or)
	$ emacs yourprogramname.cpp (or)
	$ vi yourprogramname.cpp

If you're not already an experienced user, leave emacs
and vi alone until you've a weekend to read the man page.

Compiler:
	$ g++ -g -gp -o yourprogramname  youprogramname.cpp
	$ cc  -g -gp -o yourprogramname  yourprogramname.c

Further help:
	man jpico
	man g++

---------------------------------------------------

SYSTEM ORGANIZATION

The computer is like a city.  It has neighborhoods, and buildings
in it.  Your building is your "HOME directory", and your neighborhood is
"/home/thu" or "/home/maxc".  You have a name in the computer, it is your
"login" name of "max" or "oryx" or whatever, plus two digits.

When you log on to the system, you will find yourself in your HOME
directory.  At any time you can enter the command:

pwd

to find out what directory you are in.  (pwd = Print Working
Directory)

We create "sub" directories to use to keep our files organized.  Type
the command:

	l

(that's an "ell", not a 1)

and press ENTER to see the files and directories in your current
location.  You might see, among other things:

drwx------    2 max56   students       80 2003-08-29 02:31 Documents
drwx------    2 max56   students       48 2003-10-28 20:07 asst1
drwx------    2 max56   students       48 2003-11-23 19:46 asst2
drwx------    2 max56   students       48 2003-12-16 17:20 asst3
drwx------    2 max56   students       48 2003-12-17 15:47 asst4
drwx------    2 max56   students       48 2003-12-17 15:48 asst5
drwx------    2 max56   students       80 2003-09-03 11:38 demo
drwx------    2 max56   students       80 2003-08-29 02:31 public_html

(The "max56" will be your own login, of course,
and the date/time stamps will be different.)

To "move" from one directory to another you use the
"cd" command.

If you type:

cd

by itself, and press ENTER (ALL unix commands end
with ENTER, I'm not going to say it any more) you
will return to your own HOME directory.

--------------------------

The structure of Unix commands:

cmd [-switches] [predicate...]

"cmd" is the command itself.  Some Unix commands take optional
"switches" which are preceeded by a hyphen '-', and some take
"predicates".  For example, to copy file1 to file2, you might type:

cp file1 file2

To rename asst1.c to asst1.c.bak, BUT TO CHECK THAT YOU AREN'T
OVERWRITING A PRE-EXISTING FILE NAMED asst1.c.bak, you might type:

mv -i asst1.c asst1.c.bak

The "-i" means "interactive: ask before clobbering target".

The FIRST TIME you log in, you will want to change your password, so
your files cannot be read or deleted by someone logging in as you.

To change your password, type:

passwd

REMEMBER THE NEW PASSWORD YOU CHOOSE.  If you forget it, all I can do
is reset it to something I choose.  Passwords are not stored on the
system, and are not recoverable.*

After you're done working in Unix, be sure to log off the system with:

logout


-------------------------------

To create/edit a program file.

Suppose you are going to work on the first
assignment:

cd asst0

pwd 

(just to make sure)

ls -l

(ditto)

jpico asst0.cpp

You will see your screen change, it will look like:



   UW PICO(tm) 3.7                   File: asst1.cpp                                  



<many blank lines here>

















                                     [ New file ]
^G Get Help   ^O WriteOut   ^R Read File  ^Y Prev Pg    ^K Cut Text   ^C Cur Pos    
^X Exit       ^J Justify    ^W Where is   ^V Next Pg    ^U UnCut Text ^T To Spell   

The lower part of the screen is a two-line reminder
of the Pico commands.

The "^" means: "hold down the CTRL key and press the letter
following."

With a little experimentation and practice, you will be able to create
and save program source files.

(How they do it.)

DISK FILES,  PERMISSIONS, AND MODES:

ALL C/C++ programs believe that they are accessing files on a Unix
system.  Even though Windows or Netware has a different kind of "file
system", you may, and should, write your code as if it were running on
Unix.  The compiler writers will take care of any incompatabilities.

Just remember that some features may not be available on non-Unix, so
be careful what you rely on.

EVERY FILE (and everything is a file on Unix) has four sets of
"permissions" associated with it, plus an Owner, and Owner Group.

0123456789
-rw-r--r--    1 hhaller  staff         537 2004-05-24 18:34 recursion.c

Column 0: what "kind" of a file it is.  
	'-': regular file,
	'd': directory
	'l': symbolic link
	'p': FIFO (named pipe)
	's': socket (network connection)
	'b': block special file (hard disk, etc.)
	'c': char special file (keyboard, serial port)

Columns 1-3: User (owner) permissions, r(read) w(write) x(execute)
Columns 4-6: Group        permissions, r(read) w(write) x(execute)
Columns 7-9: Other        permissions, r(read) w(write) x(execute)

There are three columns to the far left that are not displayed by ls -l:

SUID : Set User ID: let the user exeuting this program assume the privs 
       of the file Owner.

SGID : Set the Group ID: let the user executing this program assume
       the privs of the owning Group.

SSTK:  Set the Sticky Bit: See below.

STICKY FILES
       On older Unix systems, the sticky bit caused executable files to
       be hoarded in swap space.  This feature is not useful on modern
       VM  systems,  and  the  Linux  kernel ignores the sticky bit
       on files.  Other kernels may use the sticky bit on files for
       system-defined purposes.  On some systems, only the superuser
       can  set  the  sticky bit on files.

STICKY DIRECTORIES
       When  the sticky bit is set on a directory, files in that directory
       may be unlinked or renamed only by root or their owner.  Without
       the sticky  bit,  anyone  able  to write  to  the  directory
       can  delete or rename files.  The sticky bit is commonly found
       on directories, such as /tmp, that are world-writable.


------------------------------

To manipulate the file's permissions in C or C++, use chmod().
