LINUX SYSTEM ACCESS for students.

A Server is a powerful computer with dozens or hundreds of users.

Users have accounts, accounts have passwords.

Servers are very hard to get into if you're not authorized.

Buffy is a Linux Server.  Linux is an Operating System, much
more powerful and secure than Windows, but free.  Most of the
advanced nations of Europe and the Americas run most of their
enterprises with some version of Linux.  We call it LAMP for
"Linux operating System,
Apache Web server
Mariadb (was MySQL) Database manager
PHP dynamic Web Page creation."

Buffy is running SuSE Linux Leap 43.2

We "log in" to Servers.  That means, from our local computer,
run a terminal emulator, and with it, we reach across the internet and
run commands on the Server as if we were in the room with it.

How to log into Buffy: (209.129.16.61) using PUTTY.EXE
terminal emulator program:

To log into a server, you need a program which acts like a terminal, (a
device connected to a Server, which displays what's happening on on the
Server.)  Since they don't sell them any more, we use emulator PROGRAMS,
and PUTTY.EXE is a popular one for Windows.  If you're calling a Linux/Unix
system FROM ANOTHER Linux/Unix system, you don't need a terminal emulator.

For instance, from the Macintosh Command Line, you just use the ssh command.

This allows users to access the distant host using the CLI ("Command Line
Interface.")

Linux has a GUI ("Graphics User Interface") ALSO.  It is like Windows'
Presentation Manager, but much more powerful and customizable.  Students
who are going to serious 4-year schools will probably use Unix Servers,
since most campuses use them.  At SDSU and UCSD, their Unix servers
allow distant users to login using "X Windows" emulators...in other
words, it's like logging into a Windows computer and still seeing the
Graphic User Interface.  In Unix, that GUI is known as X (or X Windows).
But that requires a powerful server.  Buffy isn't powerful enough,
so we log into Buffy using the Command Line instead.

Knowing Unix is an important ability if you want to be taken seriously
in technical fields.

HOW TO LOGIN

1. Find out your login name and password.  

	Your instructor will tell you what your oryxname or maxname is,
	and what your starting password is.

2. Find the file "PUTTY.EXE" on the Windows Desktop, or else go to the
	class webpage and download it to your computer.  Double-click to run it.
	https://www.ssh.com/ssh/putty/ is the home page If you
	want the latest version. There are tutorials and other articles, otherwise,
	read system_access.txt and software.development.under.linux.txt.

(If you don't see it, go to
http://209.129.16.61/~hhaller/data/cisc192/PUTTY.EXE and click-drag
PUTTY.EXE to your desk top.)

Double Click to start it.  The "Putty Configuration" screen displays.

	When it comes up enter the IP address: 

	209.129.16.61

	in the appropriate box (read the screen)

	click the "SSH" radio button (not telnet nor rlogin, etc.,)

	On the left side of the page, go down the function tree and click "SSH"

	To use PUTTY, you'll need to configure it to use Secure Shell Protocol "2 only"
	select radio button "2 only" for Protocol.

	Click "Session" to return to the top page, and enter
	a name like "Buffy" in the space provided.

Click OK.  

A terminal window will open, light chars on black,  and you will see:

"login:" 

Enter the name you were assigned: oryx01, max87, or whatever.

A "password:" prompt will appear.  

Type in the password your instructor gave you.  AS YOU TYPE, YOUR
KEYSTROKES WILL NOT BE DISPLAYED. Use one finger. Backspace doesn't work.
This is a security safeguard.

If you log in correctly, the screen should display the welcome screen
and the Message of the Day.

If it doesn't log you on, you're making a mistake.  Do it over carefully.

You will see a dollar-sign prompt.  The system is waiting for you to
type commands. 

=====================================

OK, that's how to do it, now let's do it:

Using your account and password, log into Buffy.  She lives at: 209.129.16.61.
Once you're there, you can use Linux to learn about Linux:

For a general tour of Unix commands, at the command prompt, try: 

	man intro  

	and press ENTER.  (Always press ENTER to run a command.)

(man is the Unix Programmer's Manual online.)

(Press space to go forward a page, q to quit, / to search.

Try some commands like:
whoami
who
w
finger hhaller
finger root
last | more                (press 'q' when you're done looking).
