The Seven Things a Computer can Do:
INPUT
OUTPUT
STORE
RECALL
CALCULATE
TEST
JUMP

INPUT
Read in text or binary data
Read in single characters, words, or lines
Read in formatted characters, or voltages (square waves) from a network interface card
Read in keyboard input or telemetry from a specialized input device like a seismograph.

OUTPUT
Print text to a physical screen, 
Draw graphics using a graphics monitor
Send characters to a printer
Raise or lower voltages to a specialized device like a music board.

STORE
Store to main memory
Store to non-volatile disk
Punch a card or paper tape
Write optical media
Write to a USB device

RECALL
Recall from primary storage
Recall from disk
Read from specialized hardware

CALCULATE
Perform integer computation
Simpulate a floating-point processor
Utilize an installed FPU

TEST
Execute if(), while(), for(), or similar control structures
Compare for equality or inequality using registers, or memory locations

JUMP
Perform an unconditional branch (goto, longjmp)
Perform a computed branch like while(), for(), etc.
Call and return from subroutines.
Use a Stack to control the Instruction Pointer Register
