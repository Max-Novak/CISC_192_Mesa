Programs do a lot of arithmetic.
The arithmetic programs do is expressed in very simple
and short operations, mostly.

add: +
subtract: -
multiply: *
divide: /
find remainder: %

exponentiation: no such operator.  
	(we'll use a math library function later.)

Examples:

add 4 and 16, store the sum as x

	int x = 4 + 16

divide 22 by 7, save quotient as q

	int q = 22 / 7
	double good_quotient = 22.0 / 7.0 ;

Examples which print the results, in C++ and C:

	cout << 4 + 16 ;  printf("4 + 16 == %d\n", 4 + 16) ;
	cout << 22 / 7 ;  printf("22 / 7 == %d\n", 22 / 7) ;
	cout << 22 / 7 ;  printf("22 / 7 == %f\n", 22 / 7) ;

NOTE: statments end in semicolons.

To do real programming, we need to REMEMBER what we do.
Programs remember using VARIABLES.  For now, let's just
use whole numbers (ints).

int x, y, z ;

x = 4 ;
y = 16 ;
z = x + y ;  

Variables let us keep intermediate results.

int count = 0 ;

Add values TO count:

count = count + 4 ;

count = count + 16 ;  // count is now 20

count = count + 80 ; // count is now 100

A shorter form of the above:

int count = 0 ;

count += 4 ;

count += 16 ;

count += 80 ;

NEVER EXPECT THE SYSTEM TO ZERO YOUR VARIABLES WHEN YOU
DECLARE (create) THEM: DO IT YOURSELF.

	int count = 0 ;  // otherwise, count starts with junk already in it.

Consider:
	int count, ocount = 0  ; // (no initial zeroing of count)

	cout << "Count is: " << count << endl ;
	cout << "OCount is: " << ocount << endl ;

prints:
Count is: 134514747
OCount is: 0
