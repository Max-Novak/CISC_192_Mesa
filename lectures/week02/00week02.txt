WEEK02

READING:   Chapter 1, re-read the programming parts.1

Textbook:  Chapter 2,  Week02/files

Log on to Canvas, and post a message in General Discussion.  Ask a
question which you feel was confusing when you first came to it, then
do your best to answer the question.  Think of your classmates, and make
it a good question.

EVERY DAY(or: how to attack each assignment):
	Check the Class Syllabus/Schedule for any changes.
	Read or reread the current chapter in the TEXT.
	(Read each chapter a few times, it helps.)
	Read every file in this week## directory.
	Read the powerpoints and other files, if any.
	Read any programs.  Copy them, compile, run, and understand them.
	Re-read the asst.txt file in the current asst# assignment directory.
	Work the assignment:
		Design the solution.
		Express it in terms of the "Seven Computer Tasks".
		Work the solution with a pencil to confirm it is correct
		In the program editor, enter the solution as //comments telling WHAT to do
		Write C++ statements which translate each comment into HOW to do it.
		Compile the program and fix syntax errors
		Run the program and test the results, fix logic errors
		Copy your *.cpp file into your asst# directory for collection
		Test your work so you get it right the first time.

	If you prefer to log into Buffy and work at the Linux command line, 
	read SYSTEM.ACCESS.TXT in this directory.  It shows you how to
	save PUTTY.EXE (in this directory) to your Windows
	machine and run it to connect to Buffy.  Look at the "oryxnames" file
	in the class' root directory to find your login name and the initial 
	password the student accounts are set to. 

If you're using a Macintosh command line, you don't need PUTTY.EXE,
you can just type:

 ssh -l oryx?? 209.129.16.61       (the ?? get replaced by your login number.)

If you're at CALSTATE or UCSD, you already have a Unix account, and you can get to Buffy
from that account's command line with the ssh -l command above.  ALL LINUX COMPUTERS
can reach all other LINUX computers anywhere on Earth or low orbit.
=========================================================================


you can use
	PUTTY.EXE from a Windows box 
or 
	ssh from a Unix computer.  

Whichever you choose as your workbench, (or both if you like,) it's
all there:
OPTIONS if you want to work from home:
	1.	Download CodeBlocks MINGW and install it on your Windows box.
		find the download address in the textbook. (YOU find it.)
	2. Download PUTTY.EXE and use Buffy over the net.
		http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html
	3. Install SuSE Linux with "all development tools" selected. OR:
		https://software.opensuse.org/132/en
	4. Install Cygwyn on your Windows box.
		https://cygwin.com/install.html

Everything changes. If the URLs have changed, do a web search.
Programmers spend much of their time researching solutions.
This is a class in problem solving.

======================COURSE CONTENT===============================
You probably already know:
	Computers execute commands.
	compiled programs are called PROGRAMS.
	Commands are NUMBERS in the computer's MACHINE LANGUAGE.
	Programs operate on DATA.
	Data are also NUMBERS.

 	*	*	*	*	*	*

	Computers are composed of Hardware.  The hardware runs a super program
	called the Operating System which in turn runs Application Programs.
	As a Novice Programmer, you'll be creating Application Programs in 
	this course.

	Computers can only do Seven Things:

	//INPUT
	//STORE 
	//RECALL
	//CALCULATE
	//TEST
	//JUMP
	//OUTPUT

(That is the whole course, by the way.  From here on, we'll just be expanding
those Seven Things and how they work together.)

Every computer program can be broken down into one or more of these seven tasks.

You might like to Log into CANVAS now, and leave a message in
the General Discussion area.  You may want to talk about yourself,
why you're taking C++, what your computer experience is, your favorite
games, what systems you've worked on, what foreign languages you speak,
what parts of the world you'd like to visit, maybe work in. Hobbies,
anything relevant to the profession or your career plans.  You have
until the end of the first week to do this.

Block 2: CHAPTER 2 "Data types and storing them in C++"

READ CHAPTER 2

Variables are names for places in the computer's memory. 

Use names for variables that make sense:  Letters and digits and '_'.  
Don't _start_ with a digit or '_'.
Don't use language keywords like: if, else, int, for, use common sense.

It should be descriptive, like: hoursWorked.  

Basic Types:
only true or false:
	bool
only whole numbers:
	char
	short
	int
	long
	long long

only positive: the above prefixed with "unsigned"  like: unsigned long unitsSold ;

real numbers, whole and/or fractions:
	float  // we never use floats since the 80s passed.
	double
	long double

Variable Categories:

1) single ("scalar") variables:
Single chars, ints, doubles, whatevers.

	int age ;
	double acceleration ;

2) arrays or other collections.
A bunch of the same type, all with one name and an 'offset'.

	int  total_hours , hours[4], long long units_per_hour [24] = {0} ;
	double rate = 32.75 ;

	total_hours =  hours[0] + hours[1] + hours [2] + hours{3} ;
	grosspay = total_hours * rate ;

DECLARE THE VARIABLE BEFORE TRYING TO USE IT, or the compiler will complain.

---

Braces { and } contain ("delimit")  blocks of code.

#include <iostream> // preprocessor directives bring in source code files
							//most programs need, so you don't have to re-type them.

These files are often called "header files".  They're human-readable text.
On Buffy, they're in /usr/include and you can read them with the command less (filename)

If your program wants to communicate with the Outside World:

#include <iostream>

cout << "Hello, World\n!" ;   // write to the screen
cin  >> user_name ;           // read the keyboard


UNDERSTAND HIERARCHY OF OPERATIONS IN C/C++:

()    what's inside parentheses happens first
*  /  then multiplication and division
+ -   then addition and subtraction
=     then assigning values to variables

Classes of operation, in order of precedence
"ARITHMETIC RELATIONAL ASSIGNMENT")

Arithmetic order:

[PARENTHESES]

[MULTIPLY AND DIVIDE] 

[ADD AND SUBTRACT]



==========================================

A VERY important item for your notes is the Order in Which Things Happen:

(C Hierarchy of Execution)

() []          left to right  "group indicators"
!  ~  ++  --  +  -  *  &  (type)  sizeof right to left  "unary operators"
*  /  %        left to right   "multiplication"
+  -           left to right   "addition"
<<  >>         left to right   "bit shifting"
<  <=  >  >=   left to right   "inequality comparisons"
==    !=       left to right   "equality comparisons"
&              left to right   "bitwise AND"
^              left to right   "bitwise XOR"
|              left to right   "bitwise OR"
&&             left to right   "logical AND"
||             left to right   "logical OR"
?:             right to left   "conditional operator"
=  +=  -=  *=  /=  %=  &=  ^=  |=  <<= >>=   right to  left "assignment ops"
,           left to right   "comma"

PRINTING FROM AND READING INTO VARIABLES:
Read: iostream_one.txt in this directory.

Data have TYPE.  We seeing integers, characters, Strings, and
Boolean types (yesses and noes) in programs.  

To save data (values) we use the right types of variables.

Type specifies 
	a) how you plan to use that data,
	b) how many bytes the data occupies in memory.  

WHAT A PROGRAM LOOKS LIKE:

IOSTREAM 1

The first time you look at a C++ program, you'll see:

#include <iostream>

This "include" preprocessor directive allows you to write code
which uses the "iostream object".  This is a library of code
you DO NOT want to have to re-invent (or even re-type) every
time you write a program.  It allows you to read from
the keyboard (cin) and write to the screen (cout).  Only C++
has it, C uses simpler "library functions" from stdio.h:
#include <stdio.h>

To use iostream: #include <iostream>

Generally, it is convenient to add:

using namespace std;

to the top of your code.  If you don't, then you must
specify namespaces manually, such as: std::cout and
std::endl, instead of just using the object name.

Example:

/*
 * iostream1.cpp - demonstrate basic input-output to console
 */

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
int main()
{
  int i ;
  float f ;
  char s[81] ;

  cout << "Enter your age, weight, and name" << endl ;

  cin >> s >> i >> f ;
  cin.getline(s,80) ;	// I want all words of the name, not just the first.

  cout << "your name: " << s << endl ;
  cout << "your weight: " << f << endl ;
  cout << "your age: " << i << endl ;

  return 0 ;
}

------------------
C++ also has:
"Overloaded Objects"
Don't worry about it, just add this to your notes for later.
It means several functions can be named the same.
This is a difference between C++ and C.
------------------

The cin stream object is "overloaded", which means it's smart, and it
can see and adapt to the type of variable it's storing its input into.
But there is really a separate cin module for each data type, all called
by the same name.

The cout and cin streams have METHODS which extend their capabilities:

you can have this:


char c ;

cin >> c ; // cin knows c is a single byte, so it only stores the next 
single char.

If you want to write simpler and faster code, you can do the thinking
for cin:

char c ;

c = cin.get() ;  // get is a METHOD of the object cin

more:

cout << c ;      // cout will figure it should print only one char

cout.put(c) ;    // or you can tell it direclty using the put METHOD.

                                // 80 chars, stop at ENTER.

C++ lets you perform multiple operations:

string first ; string last ;    // create two strings

cout << "Enter first and last names separated by space:" ; // give instructions

cin >> first >> last ;         // you should run this to confirm fname and lname's landing places.
