Most modern "big" programs bought by naive organizations is made in the
third world.   An example of this is: no matter where you are in Canvas,
it's nearly always impossible to jump back a page with the BKSP or
LeftArrow icon or key.  No "breadcrumb" programming, yet that is a bare
minimum for American programmers.  Too many managers are only interested
in getting more for less, and they're so irrational they don't notice
they only get less for less.  (Economics.)

In our time, there is a whole discipline of interface design, and many
proverbs about how to avoid driving the User crazy.  This is progress.

But both Blackboard and Canvas haven't benefitted from any of it.  Drat.

That is coming up, when we begin to include code which reads and uses
the Command Line Arguments.


it's entirely permitted to do this:
string fname, mname, lname, zip ;
unsigned int age ;

cin >> fname >> mname >> lname >> age >> zip ;

for more, click CMD on your windows machine, then click in the "dos box" window, and 
type HELP <enter:  this gives a pretty exhaustive list of DOS commands.  They all
work in a Windows Dos pane.

As max45 pointed out, the Asst1 guessnum.cpp needs to have instructions
contained so a new user won't enter huge numbers.  In the early days,
software had only what the author (who was assumed to be the only User)
remembered about creating it.  

In our time, there is a whole discipline of interface design, and many
proverbs about how to avoid driving the User crazy.  This is progress.

That is coming up, when we begin to include code which reads and uses
the Command Line Arguments.
The most useful reference is the one you create.  It keeps you 
from having to look things up AGAIN.  It's tailored to YOU
since it only contains stuff YOU needed...and therefor will
likely need again.  


What we've done so far:

Enter, compile and run the Chapter 01 examples.

Enter, compile and run the guessnum.cpp program.

Play the guessnum game and develop a logical strategy 
for winning the game every time,  then describe your
strategy in two or three lines of comments in your
copy of the guessnum.cpp source file.

Confirm the correctness of your strategy by winning several
games in a row, the look up "binary search" on the web.
Enjoy the fact that you independently invented one of the
most famous algorithms in programming.

Write down any lingering questions you have about week 01
material, then get ready to begin Week 02.

We can program using CodeBlocks, at school, or on our own machines.

I've had to dig into the TOO thick book to get some idea how to use UEFI.

UEFI replaces GRUB and LILO as boot managers, and it is in fact a PRE-OS: it
can do productive and other (surveillance) work before the computer "looks" on.

UEFI is the only way to boot Terabyte disks.

----

Coeval with that, I started noticing that most Linux systems now have
hard disks of type BTRFS instead of ext3 or ext4. This utility will take a
little more study, since instead of fdisk followed by mkfs, you can run the
old fdisk, create one little primary partition (book zash?) then an 
EXTENDED PARTITION, then use MKFS.BTRFS to put a BTR fs on it.  Remember to
use mkfs.btrfs -d single  /dev/sdc5.  You see, btrfs is basically designed to
manage RAID farms, so by specifying data = single, it knows this is just
an old-fashioned or small usage for new disk tech.
