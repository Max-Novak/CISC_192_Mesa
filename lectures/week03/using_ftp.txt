This is how to upload your assignmnents to Buffy.
Read the instructions carefully and practice until you can do it
without thinking.

Eventually, you'll want to copy files between computers.  When
you're at UC or State, this will be a handy way to download class
notes.  Keep this file for future reference.

TRANSFERRING FILES TO AND FROM A SERVER USING FTP, (PSFTP.EXE)
OR SCP (scp).

Of all the non-windows utilities, this one (File Transfer Program)
is the one I've seen used the most by business and colleges.

Everybody uses ftp every day.

File Transfers copy a file from one computer, over the network,
and stores the copy on another computer where the user has access.

You either UPload or DOWNload a file.  UPload means to give, DOWNload
mean to receive.

To upload your program files for grading using ftp:

you need an ftp program.  PSFTP.EXE on the class web page
is a Windows program. To get it on your machine, point your browser
to the class web page at:
http://209.129.16.61/~hhaller/data/cisc192

Click on PSFTP.EXE where it's name appears in the list of files and
DRAG it off your browser right onto your local desktop.  Now it's on
your computer, and you can run it by double-clicking it.

a command-window will pop up, type:

	open 209.129.16.61 

when prompted "login:" enter your assigned oryxNN login
name, when prompted "passwd:" enter your password

YOUR PASSWORD WILL NOT ECHO TO THE SCREEN AS YOU TYPE.

you'll see that you're on Buffy in your home directory.  Now change
directory (cd) to the directory for the assignment you're submitting.

Change to the LOCAL directory containing your program with Local Change
Directory (lcd):

lcd e:\asst1\debug

Change to the DISTANT directory where you want to put your file:

cd asst0

Upload your local file to the distant system:

put main.cpp

Quit:
exit

You're done!
