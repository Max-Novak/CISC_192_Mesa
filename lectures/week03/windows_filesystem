The WINDOWS File System.
How disks and files are arranged.

Students have more trouble from the Windows File System than any other
topic.  It's important to be able to find stuff...especially socks.
So, let us begin correctly.

"May we be friends in confusion, so that we may be brothers and sisters
in understanding." -- Brian Bennett, Tools Group, Stanford Linear
Accelerator and Collider, 3d Dan.

Windows is built on the graveyard of DOS, Disk Operating System.  DOS was
the first universal Personal Computer system, and it was named after
the biggest part of itself, the File System.

You don't see the details of files from Windows, in fact, Windows defaults
to not showing you the full file name (the suffix is suppressed) but if
you start a Command Line window, (START->RUN->CMD) you can really explore.
Go ahead.

To look at the local neighborhood, try:

DIR

(Press ENTER after each command line command to execute it.)

A File System is the way information is organized on Storage Devices
like Disks, Memory Sticks, CD/DVD ROMs, tapes (sometimes) and suchlike.

The Windows File System is pretty much the same as DOS's, it only has
a few extra bells and whistles like longer file names, spaces in file
names (YOU WILL BE EXILED TO SIBERIA FOR USING SPACES IN FILE NAMES!) and
shared directories across a network.

Each "volume" (disk, DVD, whatever) has a name consisting of a letter
followed by a colon ':'.

A: The first  floppy.
B: The second floppy.
C: The First Hard Disk.

F:, I:, etc., devices like Memory Sticks, DVD's, etc.

Really High Letters like L:, Z:, networked drives connected to your
computer with the "map" command.

What you have to do differently for any given volume: nothing.  You just
use them.

HOW THE VOLUME IS ORGANIZED:

By "subdirectories".

On your C: drive, you probably have a subdirectory named "WINDOWS"


Look for it:

DIR C:\WINDOWS

(press Enter.)

See?

The BACKSLASH '\' separates parts of a "PATH".  A PATH is the
fully-described location of a directory or file.

In Unix the '\' is '/'.

You MOVE AROUND the file system by either CHANGING VOLUMES or CHANGING
DIRECTORIES or both.

You CHANGE VOLUMES by typing the name of the new
volume and pressing ENTER.

A:

C:

I:

You CHANGE DIRECTORIES with the "CD" command, followed by a space and
the name of the target directory you wish to change to.

You LIST THE CONTENTS OF A DIRECTORY with the "DIR" command.

You can modify commands with WILDCARDS.

To list all files which end in ".java" you would:

DIR *.java

You COPY files with:

COPY oldfile newfile

You DELETE files with:

DEL filename

You DELETE ALL FILES with:

DEL *.*

"*.*" means ALL file NAMES ending in ALL file EXTENSIONS.

File names have a first part, a period, and an extension.

The file extension tells Windows and other software what "kind" of a
file the file is.

A file that ends in ".java" is a java program we have written.  A file
that ends in ".clsss" is an EXECUTABLE Java program or library.
A file that ends in .cpp or .C is a C++ program.  A file ending in *.c
is a C program.

You can look at the contents of a file with:

MORE < filename

Unix is like DOS, but a lot better designed and stronger.
