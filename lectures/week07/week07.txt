Pointers are great, and are absolute necessities in
non-object, non-overloadable C.  They're less important
in C++, if you're content to sort of knowing what you're doing,
but not being an expert.  But some day you'll be called on to
use Assembly Languge, and if you're not expert with pointers by 
then, you soon will be.

The first time pointers surface and put a torpedo across
your bow is generally when you have to use arrays of char.
They were what we had before C++ gave us strings.

We will study arrays, array addressing, and pointer alternatives
more closely in the Caesar Block Cipher.

When you decide to write Conway's Life Game, you will have
real mastery of two dimensional arrays.


In the bb.cpp example I have presented 
C Standard Library Formatted and
C Standard Library Unformatted (Binary)

C Standard Library

FILE * = fopen(const char *, const char *) ;
fclose(FILE *) ;
fseek() 

Formatted:

fscanf (FILE *, const char *, ...) ;
fprintf(FILE *, const char *, ...) ;
fgetc()
fputc()
fgets()
fputs() 

Binary:

fwrite(void * , int size, int count, FILE *) ;
fread (void * , int size, int count, FILE *) ;
