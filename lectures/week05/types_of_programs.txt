PROGRAM STRUCTURES

Over the years, certain ways of writing C programs have withstood the
test of time and circumstances, and the Unix (and DOS) operating
systems have both shaped and been shaped by the thinking of
programmers with rich experience in C.

The most common type of C program is described in the file
program_structure_filters.  The "Unix Philosophy" is to create many
small tools which do one thing well, and to combine them with pipes,
so it is possible to string many of these small tools together to do
real work without the necessity of writing large custom programs.

Other "standard" programs are:

servers: these are programs which open a socket on the system and
listen to the network for message traffic requesting services from
them.  MYSQL, LDAP, Oracle, in fact, all network-accessable databases
are such programs, along with secure-system tools like Secure Shell.

clients: the other side of the server, they are specially-written
programs to access the server, providing it the information it needs
to function, while keeping the burden on the user to a minimum.

daemons: these are programs which, like servers, run without being
attached to any terminal or "tty".  They exist to perform routine
system tasks, and generally are started at system boot-up, and run the
entire time the system is active.  Mostly, they sleep, then at
intervals, they wake up and check to see if there is work waiting for
them.  If not, they sleep some more.  at, cron, and such fall into
this category.
