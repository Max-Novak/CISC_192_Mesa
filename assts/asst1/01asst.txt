Asst1: guessnum.cpp  50 points.

Requirements: Text: Chapter 1 read all the Week1 files, read all the
Week1/block01 files.

This isn't programming yet, it's an exercise for you to get familiar with
the tools of programming.

Here's how to attack assignment 1:

1. Read Chapter 1, decide if you want or need to install 
Code::Blocks on your home machine.

2. Whereever you do it, get Windows running.

3. Insert your URL thumb drive so Windows recognizes it.

4. Start Code::Blocks.

5. Create a console based project GUESSNUM.

6. Select "C++" as the application language.

7. Click all the "OK"s. 

8. Open the Editor, erase all the program code in main.cpp which the
system wrote for you.

9. Type the program code at the bottom of THIS file into
the editor.  Make a few mistakes, so you'll see what error 
messages look like.

10. Once you have the whole program typed in, go to the top
menu bar and click BUILD, then click BUILD on the drop-down
menu.  HOPEFULLY there are some errors there.  Read the error
messages in the error pane below the editor pane.  Compare your
code with the listing below, and make corrections.  Ones and ells
are particularly devious.

11. Click Build -- Build again.  Keep Correcting and building
until you stop getting errors.

12. Click the green arrow in the menu bar, and Guessnum will run.
Play the game as many times as you like, and come up with a plan 
to win the game every time.

	a. The secret number is between 0 and 1000.
	b. You get ten tries.
	c. Each try "cuts out" half of the remining possibilities.
	by telling you "low" or "high".
	d. The ability to divide by 2 is important.

Turn in the assignment by mailing main.cpp to the instructor with
message subject: "Asst1"

Make sure your class alias (oryxNN) and your legal name, (First,Last)
are legible in the message.

================================================================
BE SURE TO READ CAREFULLY.
READ AS MANY TIMES AS YOU NEED TO.  GO SLOW AND TAKE YOUR TIME
UNDERSTANDING THE INSTRUCTIONS.

PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENTS MAY BE TURNED IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS,
AND THE MOST FAMILIAR IS TO MAIL ME THE SOURCE PROGRAM.

================================================================


When's it Due?: see Schedule.pdf

(I'm gonna try to ensure you have your Saturdays free to do final
cleanup.  But Sunday you should start the next  chapter.)

This will not require you to make an original program, I did that for you.
You just type it in and run it.  But NEVER STOP THINKING.  As you handle
that code, read it closely, and use your common sense to make good
guesses about what each statement does.

What you should see in Code::Blocks:

Greatest causes for trouble:  Often, students won't select "Console Ap"
in Code::Blocks, and the Code Blocks IDE won't behave as is should.
Always check yourself if you see something unexpected.  Code::Blocks
is a really versatile tool, it's easy to set something incorrectly.

But if Code::Blocks is OK, then look carefully at your program: the
Error Message lists WHAT LINE is causing trouble, but very often
it's the line BEFORE that one.  Usually a missing semicolon ; 




Here's the code:

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------
*  guessnum.cpp   -  guess the number
*  (Your Name)   (date)
This is a real program.  Nothing's explained yet, just like a baby
learning to repeat adult speech.  Relax into it.
I tried to get all the SEVEN THINGS into this, so if you want, print it
out and mark it up with your guesses as to which Thing each part of the
program does.  Most right guesses gets bragging rights.
-------------------------------------------------------------------*/

#include <iostream>
#include <ctime>
#include <cstdlib>
using namespace std ;
int main ()
{
   srand(time(NULL)) ;              // "seed" the randomizer
   int limit = 1001 ;               // set a range limit
   int secret = rand() % limit ;    // % is the "remainder" operator
   int max_tries = 10 ;            
   int guess ;
   int trial = 0 ;                  

   LOOPSTART:
      trial = trial + 1 ;           // count this guess
      if (trial > max_tries )
      {
         cout << "Too many guesses: you lose.\n" ;
         return -1 ;
      }
      cout << "Guess: " ;
      cin >> guess ;

      // be nice to the user, give hints:
      if (guess < secret)
         cout << "Low\n"  ;
      else
      if (guess > secret)
         cout << "High\n" ;
      else

====================================================
I have provided you with a.out and GUESSNUM.EXE, which are 
example programs for Linux and Windows.  You may copy or download
them from this disk directory to the appropriate platforms and
run them to check how your code performs compared to them.
====================================================

Once your code is correct, get ready to upload it to Buffy for grading.

Read "using_ftp", sooner or later you'll want to use it. 
==============================
Option 0: paste your source code into a mail message and send it to me.

==============================
Option 1: Old-fashioned code PSFTP.EXE for Windows.
TRANSFERRING FILES TO AND FROM BUFFY USING PSFTP.EXE:

	Read "using_ftp" and then use PSFTP.EXE to copy guessnum's
	main.cpp to your asst1 directory on Buffy.

	Wait until the transfer is complete, then type: quit

==============================
Option 2: New PSCP.EXE for Windows, just like scp under Unix.
TRANSFERRING FILES TO AND FROM BUFFY USING PSCP.EXE:

	Read "using_ftp" and then use PSCP.EXE to copy guessnum's main.cpp
	to your asst1 directory on Buffy.

==============================
Option 3: 
LOG IN USING PUTTY AND COPY/PASTE FROM YOUR LOCAL EDITOR (CODEBLOCKS) TO
THE EDITOR ON BUFFY (nano).

If you do the work in lab, or during the on-campus office-hours meetings,
you won't have homework hanging over your head.  Also, you'll have a
much better chance of passing.  In other words, this isn't a "hard"
class, unless you make it so.  Procrastination will guarantee failure.
DO IT NOW so you really remember what you've been shown.

So take your time and do it.  Do it over and make notes until
you're sure you can do it again later.  You'll find, doing a task
right three times will generally set it in your memory for years.
