Assignment 1: Caesar Shift Cipher:

50 points.

Read in a STREAM of text, a character at a time, (not just a line,
but a stream of arbitrary length, until you encounter EOF  [cin.eof()
== true]).  And as you do so, shift each >>>letter<<<
forward in the alphabet a certain number of places.  The number of places
is read from the command line in argv[1], and turned into an int with:
int shift = atoi(argv[1]) ;

You should build on the waterpump.cpp program which was provided to you.

READ THE COMMAND LINE FOR AN INTEGER IN ARGV[1]
int shift = atoi( argc[1]) ;

Example:

shift 13
Hello, Jack
Uryyb, Wnpx


Run it through atoi() to convert the command line string to an integer:

int shift = atoi(argv[1]) ;


Remember that if you shift a letter off the end of the alphabet, we must 
"wrap around" so we come back in down by 'a'.

Here's the pseudocode:

read in a character c

if (c is a letter )
{
	make c lowercase

	make c a number between 0 and 25

	add the shift value to c

	mod c so it's between 0 and 25 again

	add a 'a' to c so it's a real ASCII letter again.
}
print c on the output  // this happens for ALL input, not just letters!

FOR UNIX HACKERS: Here's a shellscript which will run caesarshift
against an unknown file to see if it's a Caesar shift document:

#!//bin/sh
for i in `count2  25`
do
        echo -n $i
        echo -n " "
        cat $1 | /usr/local/bin/caesar $i
done

(I didn't think it needed saying, but the loop above is not part of a C++ program, it's a bash shell script
which executes the a.out compiled from your c++ code.)
