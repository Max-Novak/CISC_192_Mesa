Array_Sort

Write a single-file C/C++ program that: reads SIZE from the command line
using atoi(argv[1])

Creates an array of SIZE integers.
using int *array ; array = new int[limit] 

Fills the array with random numbers.
using array[i] = rand() % maxval

Displays the unsorted array contents, using a
separate array-printing function and calling
it with the array and its size in the argument list).

like:  sortArray(char * array, int SIZE) ;

Sorts the array into ascending order using simple Bubble Sort.
using nested for() loops

Displays the sorted array contents

For this assignment, you will need: 

for (), int rand(), The logic of Bubble Sort:

Outer forloop 
      inner forloop 
	    if array[inner] > array[inner + 1] then
	       swap array[inner] and array[inner + 1]

You may not use the standard swap() function, instead, code your own
intswap(int *, int*) function, or, you can code it this way within the
Bubble Sort:

Sample run:

a.out 3
a[1] = 671
a[2] = 859
a[3] = 518

a[1] = 518
a[2] = 671
a[3] = 859

Guru Challenge:

Since arrays aren't objects, if you "pass" one to a function, you kinda
have to include another int holding the number of elements in the array.

Can you come up with a different way of using arrays so you only need
to pass the array?  Be creative.
