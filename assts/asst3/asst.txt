DaysLived

--------------------
EXAMPLE RUN:

How many years have you lived: 15
(The "15" is TYPED BY THE USER.  It is ALL that is typed by the user.)

The demo programs are: daysPlayed  and DAYSPLAYED.EXE.

Naturally, you should try to get your numbers aligned vertically, that is always true,
and you've been hearing it since you were 8.  

You have lived:15 years:
              5475 days
           131400 hours
        7884000 minutes
      473040000 seconds


or:


           5475     days
         131400     hours
        7884000     minutes
      473040000     seconds

Just so you make it look neat, but if your boss is a real butthead, s/he can
abuse your ego by asking where the commas are.  At the professional level,
they're entitled to ask this, although I think that kind of nitpicking errs
too much on the side of being a dogmatic quibbler.

You'll get full credit on this assignment if you get the right numbers.  The last person
I heard say "neatness counts" was our company Executive Offier, who was a punk.

ASSIGNMENT:

OUTPUT the question: ask the user how many years she has lived
INPUT her answer, STORE it in years ;
Then CALCULATE how many total days she's lived.
STORE it in days
CALCULATE how many total hours that is 
STORE it in hours,
CALCULATE how many total minutes that is
STORE it in min,
CALCULATE how many total seconds that is, 
STORE it into sec
OUTPUT your results in a format that makes sense.
stop

--------------------

PSEUDOCODE:
	//INPUT the number of years played
	//CALCULATE  number of days   
	//CALCULATE  number of hours  
	//CALCULATE  number of minutes
	//CALCULATE  number of seconds
	//OUTPUT Years,
	//OUTPUT Days,
	//OUTPUT Hours,
	//OUTPUT Minutes,
	//OUTPUT Seconds

Once you have the number of years, you can find days by creating a "days"
variable, and multiplying years by 365.25:

int days = 0.5 + (years * 365.25) ;

And once you have days, you can find hours by creating "hours" and
multiplying days by....

A PROFESSIONAL WOULD CONSIDER: that many people will be a lot older than he, so they'll
test extreme ages to confirm that their logic won't "break" just because they're very young.

==================================

Optional Enhancement: #include "commas.h"

I've included "commas.h" in this directory for those who want to try their mettle against
a typical real-world challenge.

You will be looking up ways to do things throughout your career.  Now, the basic DaysLived.cpp 
isn't a big challenge, it's just input, multiplying some numbers, and printing them out.  

But if you're working on something like this, you should try to produce the best output you can.
But Neither printf()  no cout << can handle automatic placement of commas in number fields.

Years ago I fixed this problem with commas.h.  Like ALL new utilities and system calls, you
have to find it, then, you must read it and think hard about how you'll use it.

The idea is:
0. locate the function.
1. study the function
	figure out what the data types the function's parms are,
	understand the type of the value the function produces
	be sure you translate that understanding into a program which uses the new function correctly.


If you get it right, the demo program daysPlayedCommas was created this way.

If you can solve this problem you'll be working at a professional level.
