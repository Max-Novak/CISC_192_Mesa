SHERPINSKIJ01 and the ncurses library.

This is similar to guessnum, in that you don't have to do much programming.
I wanted to introduce the NCurses library, which is the easy and quick way
to write C++ programs which have control of the screen.

Something really bad happened between the days when everyone was using Apples
and Commodores, and the wide acceptance of Windows.  Early computers made it
easy for the owner to draw designs using simle BASIC.  But today, there is a
high curb in the way of anyone who wants to do that.  I've played with Python,
and it tries, and does pretty well, but the "main language" of application and
system design should not lack a good set of tools for easy graphics.

And it doesn't.  But programmers who only know Windows have limited visions
of the future.  Microsoft == Idiocracy in so many ways.

One thing I've noticed teaching C/C++, is that very few textbook writers
seem aware of anything which hasn't been sold aggressively to  Windows
programmers.  That's like a car mechanic only being really expert at
fixing tanker trucks.

So, log into Buffy, cd to your asst4 directory, start nano asst4.cpp,
and  enter the code for sherpinskij01.c, and compile it with:

cc -o sherp sherpinskij01.c -lncurses

run it with: ./sherp .


There is a lot in this program.  Students who want to experiment with curses
will find a few other programs in this directory.  Help yourself.  Just remember
to run them on a Linux system, and add the "-lncurses" linker command, so the
binary has the curses library compiled in.
